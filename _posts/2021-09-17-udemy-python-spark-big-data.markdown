- I've taken another Udemy course as part of my onboarding at **Farfetch**, which was 
Jose Portilla's [Python and Spark for Big Data](https://www.udemy.com/course/spark-and-python-for-big-data-with-pyspark/) course.
- Even though it only features *Spark 2.0*, it is a really good practical course if you 
wish to get some practice and basic leverage on the usage of spark for machine learning
applied on Big Data. It features a set of ML algorithms and different spark installations, one being on a remote databricks instance.
