<meta name="description" content="Recently, I finished an online course on Udemy called Machine Learning, Data Science and Deep Learning with Python. It was my first course on Udemy, taught by Frank Kane, founder of Sundog Education and I thought it was a very nice hands-on and practical course on machine learning using Python. It attempts to cover as much ground as possible, not going too deep on each topic but the contents explained there were understandable and it is a good way to start and get an initial grasp of Machine Learning. I’ve previously worked with Machine Learning, so not all the concepts were new to me, but it was a very interesting experience nonetheless. The course’s final project was writing code to run some algorithms on a mammographic masses dataset for classification purposes, that is to detect breast cancer, which was a simple way of implementing some of the things I learned in the course. The code is hosted here." />
