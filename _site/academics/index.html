  <li>Escola da Avenida and Externato Delfim Ferreira was where I did my basic and high school education and picked <em>Sciences and Technologies</em>. These schools are located in a village called <strong>Riba D’Ave</strong>, in the north of <strong>Portugal</strong>.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="university-2015-2020">University (2015-2020)</h4>
<ul>
  <li>I applied and got accepted to the <strong>Informatics and Computer Engineering course</strong> at the <strong>Faculty of Engineering University of Porto</strong> which was my 1st choice.
I have a <strong>MSc</strong> in this degree.
I finished with a <strong>GPA of 15</strong> (0-20) and in my MSc’s thesis, I made a <strong>Software Library for Stream-Based Recommender Systems</strong>, called <a href="https://pypi.org/project/increc/">increc</a> whose implementation and report document were graded with a <strong>19</strong> mark.</li>
</ul>

  <li>
    <p><strong>Erasmus</strong> (2019):  In my 5th year of college I decided to take part in the <strong>Erasmus</strong> student exchange program.
<strong>Technical University of Ostrava</strong>, Czech Republic was the University of my choice. There, I took courses such as <strong>Methods of Analysis of Data</strong>, <strong>Methods of Analysis of Textual Data</strong>, <strong>Parallel Computing</strong>, <strong>Biologically Inspired Algorithms</strong> and <strong>Digital Image Processing</strong>.</p>

<h4 id="other-certifications">Other certifications</h4>

<p><strong>English Certifications</strong> (2008-2012)</p>

<ul>
  <li>I registered in a English Institute in Vila Nova de Famalicão where I learned how to write, speak and listen to the english language and comprehend it better. It helped me get my <strong>First Certificate in English (FCE)</strong> which gets me at C1 level in English.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Online Courses</strong> (2020 - Now)</p>

<p>I’ve recently started taking online courses and started by using the <strong>Udemy</strong> platform.</p>

<ul>
  <li>The first course I’ve completed is named <strong>Machine Learning, Data Science and Deep Learning with Python</strong> by <strong>Frank Kane</strong>, which is a very useful practical, cut-to-the-chase course for everyone wanting to start and get an initial grasp in Machine Learning.</li>
  <li>I’ve also completed <strong>Spark and Python for Big Data with Pyspark</strong> by <strong>Jose Portilla</strong>, which is a very simple course about using PySpark to tackle Machine Learning problems which use large quantities of data.</li>
</ul>
