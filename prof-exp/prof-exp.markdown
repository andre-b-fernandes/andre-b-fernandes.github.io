#### (2018 - 2020) Jumpseller - Part-time (Student-worker).

- [**Jumpseller**](https://jumpseller.com/) is an **e-commerce provider** where you can easily set up your online store. During this period, I made part of their **software development team**. While working there I coded in **Ruby**, using the known framework **Ruby on Rails** as well as in **ReactJS** for **frontend** development. Besides this, I also worked with **job queues** using **Sidekiq**, **webhooks** for service connection, and with caching mechanisms using **Redis**. In terms of databases, I worked with both **MySQL** and **PostgreSQL** databases. Overall I gained many insights on the development and maintenance of a highly used web application as well as the software development process using **SCRUM**. It was my first job on the field, working part-time and managing my time as a student-worker.

#### (2020 - 2021) Jumpseller - Full-time.

- This is the moment I turned myself into a Machine Learning Engineer, and because it was a small company, in terms of the number of employees, I also made a lot of work in **Data Engineering**.
Initially, I was responsible for building a large-scale **Big Data** collection pipeline using AWS services, namely **AWS Kinesis Firehose** for stream-data collection which is stored in **AWS S3**, processed and aggregated using **AWS Glue**, and queried using **AWS Athena**.
I've also helped implement a more robust search mechanism for the main project using **ElasticSearch**.

- I worked on a large-scale online machine learning project related to recommendations.
I've worked with content-based recommendations using a NLP deep learning neural network architecture called **Word2Vec**, and also collaborative filtering using item-based recommendations
with cosine similarity and a session-based recommender system (**GRU4REC** neural network). I've also used **ElasticSearch** for this task.
This project's architecture is much different than the usual applications I've done so far since it's done mostly via separated **Docker** images stored using **AWS ECR**, and because
it has to interconnect with the main project which has been a challenge but very fun to do. The models are trained and served using **AWS Sagemaker**. It includes a deploy CI/CD pipeline which deploys the project when in the master branch using **Gitlab** pipelines.
I used **Python** and some of its libraries such as **Numpy**, **Tensorflow**, and **Pandas**. I also want to note that a component of this project was an on-demand machine learning model which can be asked for predictions in a **Flask** server.

#### (2021 - 2023) Farfetch

I've started working at [**Farfetch**](https://www.farfetch.com) in September 2021, and I was a part of Farfetch's recommendations cluster working as a machine learning engineer in Porto.
I worked together with data scientists and machine learning engineers as well as product
managers in a professional environment.
I've started using other technologies such as **PySpark**, **Azure Pipelines** and **Databricks** for an integrated ML and data platform.
Together we built products using **Approximate Nearest Neighbour Search** and used the **Resnet** and **LSTM** architectures to build an outfit recommendations generator. Lastly, we were able to powere this recommender with the **Vespa.ai vector database**.

#### (2023-Now) Revolut


Currently working in the fincrime department, in a fast-paced and quick-changing environemnts building models
to detect fraudulent CNP transactions. Using a lot of data analysis tools, I improved my usage of **pandas** and **plotly.express** for data manipulation
and data visualization.
For OLAP queries I became fluent with **Trino** and am using **SQL** on a daily basis, as well as acquired a lot of **Regression Trees** and **Gradient Boosting Mode** knowledge.
